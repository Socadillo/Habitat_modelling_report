The benthic macro-invertebrate samples were taken at two sites near lake Lunz (Mostviertel, lower Ausrtria). For reference conditions the Ois River in Lunz am See was sampled~(\cref{fig:site_reference}). This small, natural, alpine river represents the headwaters of the Ybbs River and subsequently flows into the Danube river. The second sampling site was the so called Maiergraben, a small, concreted, channelized creek flowing through a forested area into lake Lunz~(\cref{fig:site_impactedA}).

\subsubsection{Multi-Habitat Sampling (MHS)}\label{sec:mhs}         %% Describe MHS


For this approach the examined river reach was partitioned into 20 subunits. These sampling units were representing different habitat types (choriotopes) and their proportional areal coverage within the reach. Sampling units were characterized by both mineral~(\cref{tab:choriotope_mineral}) and biotic~(\cref{tab:choriotope_biotic}) habitats.

First the share of mineral habitat classes was defined, secondly the biotic habitats within the mineral habitats were classified. This was done by a visual estimation of the area. For every 5\% of a certain choriotope (combination of mineral and biotic habitat) one sampling unit was chosen. The shares and subunits of each choriotope were then put in a field-protocol~(see~\hyperref[appendixA]{Appendix A}).

Sampling units also had to be distributed accordingly between the mesohabitats (river bottom/bank, lentic/lotic, riffles/pools). As the sampling area should not be disturbed beforehand, the sampling started downstream and then proceeded upstream.

Sample collection at each sampling unit was performed with a stationary rectangular net (Mesh size: \SI{500}{\micro\meter} EU standard) and by disturbing a quadratic area upstream of the net (25x25cm). For the Ois River we chose 10 sampling locations where we took 2 samples each, for a total of 20 units~(\cref{tab:choriotope_ois}).




Since the Maiergraben had a very homogenous structure we chose only four sampling locations â€“ three in the creek and one under a small bridge. We collected 5 samples from each location for a total of 20 sampling units.~(\cref{tab:choriotope_maiergraben,fig:site_impactedB})

Samples taken from organic habitats, always had to include the underlying mineral substrates. The different mineral habitats needed to be sampled accordingly.
\begin{list}{}
  \item {\textbf{Megalithal:} Boulders were sampled from all sides by sweeping the surface with a brush and flushing the animals into the net.}
  \item {\textbf{Macro- and Mesolithal:} Surface dwelling animals were flushed in the net by gently sweeping the cobbles or stones by hand. Next clingers and sessile animals were scratched off with a brush. Finally, the underlying substrate (within 15 to 20 cm depth) was churned by foot.}
  \item {\textbf{Microlithal and Akal:} Coarse gravel and sandy substrate was sampled by disturbing the sediment by kicking it downstream the net.}
\end{list}

After sampling each unit, the content of the net was transferred first into a tray and then into a closable bucket, which was filled with ethanol, in order to kill the animals.


\subsubsection{Sorting Techniques}\label{sec:sorting_technigues}      %% Describe impacted site

To sort the animals by size classes the buckets contents were later put through a sieve tower with different mesh sizes (\SI{10}{\milli\meter} down to \SI{500}{\micro\meter}). The different fractions were then placed in trays~(\cref{fig:sorting_tray}), so animals could be sorted, counted and determined to screening taxa level with the help of binoculars~(\cref{fig:sorting}). Only whole animals, so no single body parts, empty shells, exuvies or headless animals were taken into account. In trays with large amounts of animals (usually the smaller fractions) rare or single-occurring animals were taken out, and the rest was subsampled. This was done by transferring the animals in another tray that consisted of a grid, separating the tray into 16 or 8 cells. The organisms of usually two representing subsamples were determined and counted. The number of animals then had to be multiplied accordingly.
A taxa list was created with MS Excel and further analysis were made with the programs MS Excel and EcoProf (version 4.0.0).
